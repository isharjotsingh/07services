/*Third Question
a. Access Specifiers -: there are of four types which used to define the accessibility of class and function

1. public : it are used with the keyword public and used within class, within package ,outside the package and outside the class.
2. protected: it are used with the keyword protected and used within class, within package and outside the package with sub classes.
3. private: it are used with the keyword private and used within the class only.
4. default: it are used automatically when we not used the keyword and used within the class and package.
 */

/* b.Packages -: it are the folder where we save the java files. it can be import from other folder with "import 'folder name'.'class name' "
 */

/*c. final Keyword -: When final keyword is used then the value of that variable is not change id do so the compiler show errors.
example: 
public class Final{ 
    public static void main(String[] args){
        final int i = 10;
        //if we add i=77 here it will show error
        System.out.println("value of i "+i);
    }
}*/
